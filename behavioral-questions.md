# ASSESSMENT 3: Behavioral Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. Use the Nugget + STAR method for each answer.

1. Tell me about a project or accomplishment youâ€™re proud of.

- Nugget:during my time in the Marine Corps i strived to become the best version of myself i could possibly be, to do this i had to push my mind, body, and spririt to its limits. 
- Situation:eventually there came an opportunity to become a matrial art instuctor within the marine corps. 
- Task: to do so i would have had to endure a 3 week course where i would have to pass a 2 written tests, all belt tests that i would be testing others on, a technique teaching test and finally i had to pass a course teaching test. 
- Action: as soon as i started the course i knew the first two tests would be the written tests so studied day in and day out to be able to pass those tests, for the belt tests i spend time on my own going over the techniques to make sure i would know the names and not mess up executing the actual technique, for the technique teaching test i knew i had to remember all safties and step by step how to execute a technique so i studied that technique until i could recite it straight from memory. and finaly for the course teaching test i knew i stuggled with speaking in front of large groups so everyday from week 2 to week 3 i did everything to get myself to speak in large groups, to get myself out of my comfort zone and basically get myslef to be comfortable being uncomfortable. 
- Result: after doing all these things during the course, i passed having gotten above 90% on both written tests, passed all belt tests with only one retest, passd the teaching test on the first try, and passed the course teaching test with flying colors. 

2. Tell me about a time when you had to deal with a high-pressure situation in your job.

- Nugget:after i got out of the marine corps my first job was at a car dealership, taking pictures of the vehicles and driving cars to and from our contractors sites. 
- Situation: on my second week working there my cowoker who did the same job as me called out sick and i was left on my own to do the job. 
- Task:i had to take pictures of all the cras that came in during the day while also driving vechicles to and from our contractors site. 
- Action: our contractors take priority so i would take the repaired vehicles first then when i returned to the dealership i would take picture of the vehicles until the next vechile was ready to be returned. i kept this system going until all the work was completed 
- Result: all the work got done with not a single person worrying about the contractor vechiles or the vehicles at the dealership being backed up.
